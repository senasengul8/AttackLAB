# Attack LAB

four attacks on two programs having different security vulnerabilities.


  different ways that attackers can exploit security vulnerabilities when programs do not safeguard

  
themselves well enough against buffer overflows.


 get a better understanding of how to write programs that are more secure, as well as
some of the features provided by compilers and operating systems to make programs less vulnerable.


 deeper understanding of the stack and parameter-passing mechanisms of x86-64 machine code.

 
 deeper understanding of how x86-64 instructions are encoded.

 
 more experience with debugging tools such as GDB and OBJDUMP.
